TODO:

- Google API call is timing out when we send all champion data (FIXED)
- Dynamic thread waiting instead of every 1.3s, multiple threads when searching for recent games - need to synchronise mongo collection (WIP)
- Google sheet visuals for scoring systems
- Another sheet for player stats, categorised somehow by tank/adc/apc/etc
- Cache player / champion stats, shouldnt need to recalculate stats if #games hasent changed
- Add bold to titles
- Cache champion names
- Only store summoner name in globals, lookup and cache summoner id and other names
- Support name changing by only storing summonerId (cache)
- Store 'last updated edition' in a DB, use this to see if we need to update the cache

Stats:
Remove heal/phys player/phys creep/cc
Add dmg taken/deaths
