TODO:

- Google API call is timing out when we send all champion data (FIXED)
- Dynamic thread waiting instead of every 1.3s
- Google sheet visuals for scoring systems
- Another sheet for player stats, categorised somehow by tank/adc/apc/etc
- Cache player / champion stats, shouldnt need to recalculate stats if #games hasent changed
- Add bold to titles
